# Data Science Final Project - Global Plastic Pollution

## Introduction
For our project, we wanted to examine the amount of plastic pollution that exists in our oceans, and be able to predict how large of an issue it will be in the future.

## Data Selection
Our data training is conducted using a Jupyter notebook found here (will link notebook). Our data consists of two primary datasets:

### Total Global Plastic Production
This data has 3 important features:
1. Entity (World in this case, since it's global)
2. Year
3. Amount of plastic (weighed in million tonnes)

This gives us a total amount of plastic that is produced by the year, and we are able to compare this data with our second dataset that involves individual countries.
